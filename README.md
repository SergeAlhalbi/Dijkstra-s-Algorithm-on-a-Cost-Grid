# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-on-a-Cost-Grid
Nodes and nonnegative edges are necessary for Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to build a reliable network. A standard grid can take a form of an unambiguous network. A cost grid also more accurately reflects the environments. Each board cell on a cost square grid with the dimensions max_val by max_val is assigned a value between 1 and max_cost. The line linking one vertex to the opposite end on the other side is said to be the shortest "route" if it has the lowest sum of cell values along the way. Obstacles cells are designated by inf to signify an endless journey to them in order to account for the barriers. These obstacles are produced at random, and obstacles_number indicates how many are present. Start and end locations are defined by the user and have no expenses. Note that, if max_cost = 2 then the cost grid reduces to a standard grid with uniform costs = 1.
